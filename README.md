# Optimizing commercial performance of an US Airline network
### Introduction
I am working as a Consulting Business Consultant for a Airline consulting company here in Germany, where I was asked to study the use case for a popular American Airline's and its commercial viability for the netwrok's benefits by operating on certain regions of the world

### Requirement Specification
A network carrier in the United States wants to enable its network planners to quickly run analyses to 
check the business case of adding or cancelling flights in next yearâ€™s summer plan between any given 
origin and destination in the world. This would be a big step forward for this airline, as today their 
analysts use multiple spreadsheets to run these calculations. Analysts can take days to make these 
calculations, drawing from various data sources to understand the commercial impact of changes. As 
analysts use their own calculations, based on their own experience, and their own data, it is hard to 
collectively work towards a collective network's optimal commercial performance. 

Additionally, the airline wants to include a new data source, provided by the International Air 
Transport Association (IATA), that includes aggregated booking data from all airlines operating 
between any given origin and destination. This new competitor data source should complement the 
current data sources, which include fleet data, operational cost data, airport data, and tax data. 
Ultimately the airline wants an intuitive tool that allows their network planners to take a uniform 
approach to calculate the financial impact of network changes as a team. 

The customer airline only has a budget of $500k and expects a go-live within the next 6 months. The Company 
will carry the end-to-end responsibility for developing this solution. We provide the following 
resources: 1 project manager, 1 data engineer, 2 data scientists, and 1 business data analyst.
